# Overseer
Program to watch over the activities of a CTF game.

To get this project started, you will need pylibpcap, and the construct packages. We suggest installing using pip, and controlling the installs using virtualenv.

PyLibPCAP
---------
PyLibPCAP is used for sniffing the network activity, and may be obtained from the following site:
	http://ncu.dl.sourceforge.net/project/pylibpcap/pylibpcap/0.6.4/pylibpcap-0.6.4.tar.gz

Construct
---------
Construct is used for dealing with structures and packing/parsing data into and out of these structures. Use pip to install (pip install construct)

Note for Adam: To run test code, "python -m test.snifferTest"
